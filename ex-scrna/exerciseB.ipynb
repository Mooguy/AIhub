As we are practicing here data analysis, which is always done under uncertainty, you will find that in many cases you need to make hard decisions on parameters/algorithms/visualization. This is OK. There is no single “correct” solution – a perfect project will be one that conveys understanding of the underlying data using the methodologies we studied.<br />\n",
